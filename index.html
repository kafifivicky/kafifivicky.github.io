    <h2>About me</h2>

I am Victoria, a confident, determined and grounded individual. I live by the motto that by respecting others, I make a meaningful contribution to humanity.
I am an open minded and a very hard working person, characteristics I sharpen in each project I am involved with, both past and present. I do enjoy socialising with people from all walks of life, through many different activities such as taking long walks, traveling or just by engaging in any outdoors and indoors activities.

As I work, every day, on becoming a better me, I aim in positively add towards making Humanity greater.

Despite being passionate about many other matters in life, I truly enjoy reading and writing, therefore, I am pursuing a career in journalism and media. I have been honoured to meet and work with many great people in the Fashion industry from whom I am inspired by.

I hope that you enjoy your time here reading these pages.
